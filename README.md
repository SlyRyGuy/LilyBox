Files for the Custom Small Size Hitbox: LilyBox!


Got fed up with the lack of small size enclosures for Hitbox Controllers that would allow you to fit arcade buttons and also allow you to use the shiokenstar layout, so I ended up just making my own. 

#### Dimensions: 12" x 7.5" x 2.25" 

Supports GP2040 type pcbs, space is allocated in the case to fit the usb extender. 
Back wall of the LilyBox has 5x 24mm holes for auxiliary buttons. 
The main panel has a shiokenstar layout, 5x 24mm holes (3x for typical directions and 2x for extra buttons) and 9x 30mm Holes for typical arcade switches. Designed primarily to fit Crown buttons, but if your button is shorter than around 2" with wires put into them it should fit as well. 

As seen, the design is a little bit odd and scuffed. Thus, I named it after my SF6 Main, Lily, who is scuffed in very similar ways. 

I have been using the controller since first designing it a few months before posting it, and it has worked just perfect.
